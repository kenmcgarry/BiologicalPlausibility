# BiologicalPlausibility
Bioinformatics algorithms need the ability to assess the relevance and biological plausibility of their discoveries discoveries.

The past 20 years as seen the rapid development and application of numerous computational methods for analyzing bioinformatic data generated from genomic, proteomic and metabolic studies. This has taken place against the backdrop of ever increasing volumes of data with increasing complexity and sophistication. What perhaps has been lacking in the majority of methods is the ability to assess and relevance and biological plausibility of the machine learning discoveries. In this paper we devise a system for uncovering. 
The term {\it biological plausibility } relates to a set of criteria defined by Bradford-Hill to assess the association between some biological entity and a disease or some risk factor \cite{Hill1965,McGarry2017a}. The explanation for the link should be plausible and explicable according to the known facts of biology of the disease in question.
Methods, such as clustering can also reveal the modular nature of proteins as they cooperate in various activities \cite{Barabasi2011,McGarry2013}.
