# BiologicalPlausibility
Bioinformatics algorithms need the ability to assess the relevance and biological plausibility of their discoveries.

The past 20 years as seen the rapid development and application of numerous computational methods for analyzing bioinformatic data generated from genomic, proteomic and metabolic studies. This has taken place against the backdrop of ever increasing volumes of data with increasing complexity and sophistication. What perhaps has been lacking in the majority of methods is the ability to assess and relevance and biological plausibility of the machine learning discoveries. The term `biological plausibility` relates to a set of criteria defined by Bradford-Hill to assess the association between some biological entity and a disease or some risk factor, the `Bradford-Hill criteria` has seen much use of the years for epidemiological studies. The explanation for the link should be plausible and explicable according to the known facts of biology of the disease in question. 

In our work we incorporate information theoretic approaches for the assessment and biological validity of modules discovered by the clustering process. The use of ontologies (within reason) play a major role in this assessment process. The intention, is not only to provide the best solution but to provide an explanation of why one answer should be preferred over the others. This is the approach favored by clinicians and biomedical scientists to understand the impact and significance of any bioinformatic discovery.
