## About these files....

The files here are (as usual) in a state of flux. Expect changes almost daily to the R code.

When all files are completed they should:

`main.R`, The starting point of our journey, first file to be called up and loads in libraries, data and any functions.

`community.R`, builds protein complex networks from STITCH/STRING data, extracts modules (communities) from the complex networks. 

`infotheory.R`, implements most of the mutual information caluclations using the [infotheory](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/infotheo/index.html "CRAN Repository") package by Meyer.

`BradfordHill.R`, implements some/maybe all of the nine [Bradford-Hill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bradford_Hill_criteria "Yes, I know Wikipedia!") criteria for biological plausibility.

`plotfigures.R`, implements the plots/diagrams in the paper and also some eye candy diagrams for main system figure.
