# BradfordHill.R
# Implements aspects of the nine Bradford-Hill criteria for biological plausibility and coherence.

# 1. Strength of the association, the stronger the association the more likely that the association is causal.
# 2. Consistency , if more studies find similar results, the more likely it is that the association is causal.
# 3. Specificity, a specific exposure should exert a specific effect. There are causal associations that are not
#   specific, for example, cigarette smoking,  which are associated with multiple carcino-genic effects.
# 4. Temporality, the causal exposure should precede the caused disease in time.
# 5. Biological gradient or dose response. If is seen then more likely that the association is causal. 
# 6. Plausibility depends on the current knowledge of the etiology of the disease. For instance, is it known that
# the agent or metabolite reaches the target organ, are studies in animal models positive?
# 7. Coherence, refers to other observed biological ef  logical changes in the target organ.
# 8. Experimental evidence,if the disease rates go down after the causal agent has been eliminated, it is sup-
#  port for a causal association.
# 9. Analogy, if a similar agent exerts similar effects, it is more likely that the association is causal.
